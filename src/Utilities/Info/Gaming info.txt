 Heading:-It’s Possible to Go Shark Surfing in Sons of the Forest


 Info:-The fact that Sons of the Forest has been released to early access means that there's bound to be a few bugs, and one person has noticed a glitch that allows players to go surfing on the back of a shark. Although it's an indie title, Endnight's sequel to The Forest has been one of the biggest horror game releases of 2023 so far. It may be going up against the Resident Evil 4 remake and Alan Wake 2, but this creepy survival game shows there's a lot of love for the smaller studios.

 Date:-Sons of the Forest is out in early access on PC.
